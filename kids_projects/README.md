### sensehat_text.py ###
Every time a key is pressed it gets displayed in the sense hat led matrix using a random color.
To make it easier for the kids to play, and to keep them away from my laptop, I am reading the key presses from an external keyboard (a Logitech K400 BTW) using the evdev module
Also, the letters are upside down, so the rpi can be placed on a flat surface
